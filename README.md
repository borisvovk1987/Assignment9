# Assignment9
Assignment 9 in C++ course, AU.

In this assignment we were asked to create functions that test for various options of cases.In this repository you will find 3 files regarding the ninth exercise given in CPP course. 
  - TestCase.cpp - is the class we wrote with the code needed for the functionality of our class TestCase.
    TestCase.h - is the header file with everything needed for our TestCase.cpp code to work. 
  - MAIN/main.cpp - the main provided from the assignment's github.
  - Makefile - is makefile we wrote for compilation.

All 3 files were compiled and tested using the main included in this repository
(taken from: [homework](https://github.com/erelsgl/ariel-cpp-5778/blob/master/week09-metaprogramming/homework/homework.pdf)). 
Please note the documentation throughout the code.
